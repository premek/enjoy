=== day1

(Monday May 9th, 2016)

It was a day like any other.
I left my apartment in the morning and went to the office.



=== first_meeting ===
This must be the guy living in the apartment next to yours.
"Morning", he said.
* [...]He looks weird
  I left without talking to him.
* "Morning"[], I replied.
  "Enjoy your day," he said to me,
  "And enjoy your life!" he shouted at me as I was leaving

=== second_meeting ===
Can I ask you a question?
* [Try to avoid talking to him]"Sorry I'm in a hurry"
* [Yes]Sure
  Do you know what is going on here?
* * Like in this house?
* * No
    You know, I'm in in a movie.
    And it doesn't look good for me.
    Can you help me?
* * * Of course
* * * How?
      Mom, dad, brother, I'm so sorry.
      You know, I'd like to be with my family.
      With my mom, my dad and brother.
      Right now.
